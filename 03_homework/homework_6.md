**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


Introducing ethics or inequity components at a financial institution could, and in many cases <b>should</b> be done through greater transparency of business operations, asset allocations, and lending practices as was very obviously brought to light by the collapse of Silicone Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023. 

While this could be more of a problem within US-based financial institutions simply due to volume some of these issues are also evident in Canada. Most recently Toronto-Dominion was fined by FINTRAC for not disclosing suspicious transactions that were called out by the US D.O.J.

On the one hand I could understand the desire to not disclose such transactions since the banking operates on a fee-per-transaction model and doing so would be hurting the firms's bottom line, at the same time the risk of potentially funding radical activities is not insignificant. 

This could be done via from a high level of tighter Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules, to a more granular level of having better monitoring systems on transactions, transactions patterns that are subject to the "offending" firm's intervention but rather are monitored by a third-party entity. Having a third-party would help to introducing impartiality and has a far greater chance of ensuring the agreed ethical standards and guidlines are followed.
